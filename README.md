# SWPListData

Swift example of reading multi-level data from a PList file, and displaying it in "drill-down" table views.

Please Note: this is just ONE example of ONE approach to the task. It would, of course, need plenty of additional error handling, data validation, etc... It is simply demonstrating a couple ideas.
